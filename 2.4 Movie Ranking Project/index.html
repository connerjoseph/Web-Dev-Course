<h1>Conner's Cinema!</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This movie was seen on a special film roll back in 2014 with 2 of my firends. We all walked out of the cinema in London lost for words and teary eyed.</p>

<h3>Before Sunrise</h3>
As someone who started in a long term relationship this movie hits home. Setting up for the challenges of love.

<h3>The Social Network</h3>

Inspiring, maybe why I am here today?
